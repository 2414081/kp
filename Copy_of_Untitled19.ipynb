This is most commonly due to **atherosclerosis**—the buildup of fatty plaques in the coronary arteries that narrows the vessels and reduces blood flow. \\n\\nKey factors contributing to chronic stable angina include:\\n\\n1. **Coronary artery disease (CAD):** The narrowing of coronary arteries due to plaque buildup limits blood flow, especially during physical exertion or stress when the heart's oxygen demand increases.\\n   \\n2. **Imbalance between oxygen supply and demand:** Stable angina occurs when the oxygen demand of the heart (e.g., during exercise or emotional stress) exceeds the oxygen supply due to restricted blood flow.\\n\\n3. **Endothelial dysfunction:** Damage to the inner lining of the blood vessels can impair their ability to dilate properly, further reducing blood flow.\\n\\nChronic stable angina is characterized by predictable chest pain or discomfort that occurs during exertion or stress and is relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. It reflects a stable pattern of ischemia without acute changes, unlike unstable angina or myocardial infarction.\", \"Chest pain in chronic stable angina is typically relieved by **rest** or the use of **nitroglycerin**. \\n\\n1. **Rest**: When a person with chronic stable angina stops physical activity or reduces exertion, the heart's oxygen demand decreases, alleviating the pain.\\n\\n2. **Nitroglycerin**: This medication works by dilating blood vessels, improving blood flow to the heart, and reducing the heart's workload, which helps relieve angina symptoms quickly.\\n\\nIf chest pain persists despite these measures, it may indicate a more serious condition, such as unstable angina or a myocardial infarction, and immediate medical attention is necessary.\"]\n"

            "Verification Answers: [\"Chronic stable angina is typically evaluated using a combination of clinical assessment, laboratory tests, and diagnostic imaging to assess the presence and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD). Common diagnostic tests include:\\n\\n### 1. **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**\\n   - A resting ECG is often the first test performed to evaluate angina symptoms. It may show signs of ischemia, such as ST-segment depression or T-wave inversion, but it can also be normal in patients with stable angina.\\n   - A stress ECG (exercise treadmill test) is used to assess the heart's response to physical exertion and detect ischemia.\\n\\n### 2. **Stress Testing**\\n   - **Exercise Stress Test**: Monitors ECG changes, heart rate, and blood pressure during physical activity. It is useful for diagnosing CAD and assessing functional capacity.\\n   - **Stress Echocardiography**: Combines stress testing with echocardiography to evaluate wall motion abnormalities during stress, which may indicate ischemia.\\n   - **Nuclear Stress Test**: Uses radioactive tracers (e.g., technetium or thallium) to assess blood flow to the heart muscle during stress and rest. It can identify areas of reduced perfusion.\\n\\n### 3. **Echocardiography**\\n   - A resting echocardiogram evaluates heart structure and function, including left ventricular function and wall motion abnormalities that may suggest ischemia or prior infarction.\\n\\n### 4. **Coronary Angiography**\\n   - This invasive test is considered the gold standard for diagnosing CAD. It involves injecting contrast dye into the coronary arteries to visualize blockages or narrowing. It is typically reserved for patients with severe symptoms or those being considered for revascularization (e.g., stenting or bypass surgery).\\n\\n### 5. **Cardiac CT Angiography (CTA)**\\n   - A non-invasive imaging test that uses computed tomography to visualize coronary arteries and detect plaque or stenosis. It is particularly useful for patients with intermediate risk of CAD.\\n\\n### 6. **Blood Tests**\\n   - **Lipid Profile**: Evaluates cholesterol levels (LDL, HDL, triglycerides) to assess cardiovascular risk.\\n   - **Blood Glucose and HbA1c**: Screens for diabetes, which is a major risk factor for CAD.\\n   - **High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP)**: Assesses inflammation, which may be associated with atherosclerosis.\\n   - **Cardiac Biomarkers**: Troponin levels are typically normal in stable angina but may be checked to rule out acute coronary syndrome.\\n\\n### 7. **Ambulatory ECG Monitoring (Holter Monitor)**\\n   - Used to detect arrhythmias or transient ischemic changes during daily activities, especially if symptoms are intermittent.\\n\\n### 8. **Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI)**\\n   - Measures blood pressure in the arms and legs to screen for peripheral artery disease, which often coexists with CAD.\\n\\n### 9. **Coronary Calcium Score**\\n   - A non-invasive CT scan that quantifies calcium deposits in the coronary arteries. It helps assess the risk of CAD, especially in asymptomatic patients or those with atypical symptoms.\\n\\n### 10. **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**\\n   - Cardiac MRI can be used to evaluate myocardial perfusion and viability, but it is less commonly used than other imaging modalities for stable angina.\\n\\nThe choice of diagnostic tests depends on the patient's clinical presentation, risk factors, and pre-test probability of CAD. Stress testing and imaging are often prioritized for patients with intermediate risk, while invasive coronary angiography is reserved for high-risk patients or those with severe symptoms.\", \"Coronary angiography is typically performed for chronic stable angina in the following cases:\\n\\n1. **High-risk findings on non-invasive testing**: If a patient undergoes stress testing (e.g., exercise stress test, stress echocardiography, or nuclear imaging) and the results suggest high-risk features, such as significant ischemia or poor functional capacity, coronary angiography may be indicated to assess the severity and location of coronary artery disease (CAD).\\n\\n2. **Symptoms refractory to medical therapy**: If a patient with chronic stable angina continues to experience significant symptoms despite optimal medical therapy (e.g., anti-anginal medications like beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, and lifestyle modifications), coronary angiography may be performed to evaluate the need for revascularization.\\n\\n3. **Suspected left main or multivessel disease**: Patients with clinical features or non-invasive test results suggesting left main coronary artery disease or significant multivessel disease may require coronary angiography to confirm the diagnosis and guide management.\\n\\n4. **Assessment prior to revascularization**: If revascularization (e.g., percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] or coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) is being considered, coronary angiography is necessary to determine the anatomy and feasibility of the procedure.\\n\\n5. **Uncertain diagnosis**: In cases where the diagnosis of CAD is uncertain despite non-invasive testing, coronary angiography may be performed to clarify the diagnosis.\\n\\n6. **Worsening symptoms or clinical instability**: If a patient with chronic stable angina develops worsening symptoms, signs of unstable angina, or other concerning features (e.g., heart failure, arrhythmias), coronary angiography may be indicated to assess for progression of CAD.\\n\\n7. **Special populations**: In certain high-risk populations, such as patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or reduced left ventricular function, coronary angiography may be considered earlier due to their increased risk of adverse outcomes.\\n\\nThe decision to perform coronary angiography should be individualized, taking into account the patient's clinical presentation, risk factors, and preferences, as well as the potential risks and benefits of the procedure.\"]\n"

The primary treatment options include:\\n\\n### 1. **Lifestyle Modifications**\\n   - **Smoking cessation**: Avoiding tobacco use is critical to reducing cardiovascular risk.\\n   - **Dietary changes**: Adopting a heart-healthy diet, such as the Mediterranean diet, which is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.\\n   - **Regular physical activity**: Engaging in moderate aerobic exercise (e.g., walking, cycling) as tolerated, under medical supervision.\\n   - **Weight management**: Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight to reduce strain on the heart.\\n   - **Stress management**: Techniques such as mindfulness, yoga, or counseling to reduce stress, which can exacerbate angina.\\n\\n### 2. **Pharmacological Therapy**\\n   - **Nitrates**: Short-acting nitrates (e.g., nitroglycerin) are used for immediate relief of angina symptoms, while long-acting nitrates (e.g., isosorbide mononitrate) can help prevent episodes.\\n   - **Beta-blockers**: These reduce heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand, improving symptoms and exercise tolerance.\\n   - **Calcium channel blockers**: Used to relax blood vessels, reduce heart rate, and improve blood flow to the heart. Examples include amlodipine and diltiazem.\\n   - **Antiplatelet agents**: Aspirin or clopidogrel is often prescribed to reduce the risk of clot formation and prevent cardiovascular events.\\n   - **Statins**: These lower cholesterol levels and stabilize atherosclerotic plaques, reducing the risk of progression of coronary artery disease.\\n   - **Ranolazine**: A second-line agent that helps reduce angina symptoms by improving myocardial metabolism without affecting heart rate or blood pressure.\\n   - **ACE inhibitors or ARBs**: These may be prescribed for patients with hypertension, diabetes, or heart failure to improve cardiovascular outcomes.\\n\\n### 3. **Interventional Procedures**\\n   - **Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)**: Angioplasty with stent placement may be considered for patients with significant coronary artery blockages who do not respond adequately to medical therapy.\\n   - **Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)**: Surgery may be recommended for patients with severe or complex coronary artery disease.\\n\\n### 4. **Risk Factor Management**\\n   - **Hypertension control**: Maintaining blood pressure within target ranges.\\n   - **Diabetes management**: Tight glycemic control to reduce cardiovascular risk.\\n   - **Lipid management**: Aggressive treatment of dyslipidemia with statins or other lipid-lowering agents.\\n\\n### 5. **Patient Education**\\n   - Educating patients about recognizing angina symptoms, using nitroglycerin appropriately, and seeking medical attention for worsening or unstable symptoms.\\n\\nTreatment plans should be individualized based on the severity of symptoms, comorbid conditions, and patient preferences. Regular follow-up is essential to monitor progress and adjust therapy as needed.', \"Revascularization is considered in the management of chronic stable angina under specific circumstances, particularly when medical therapy is insufficient or when there are high-risk features. The decision to pursue revascularization is guided by clinical symptoms, functional limitations, and diagnostic findings. Key indications include:\\n\\n1. **Persistent Symptoms Despite Optimal Medical Therapy**: \\n   - Revascularization is considered for patients who continue to experience angina despite being on optimal medical therapy, including anti-anginal medications (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates) and risk-modifying treatments (e.g., statins, antiplatelet agents).\\n\\n2. **High-Risk Features on Non-Invasive Testing**:\\n   - Patients with evidence of significant ischemia on stress testing (e.g., large areas of ischemia or reduced left ventricular function) may benefit from revascularization to reduce the risk of adverse cardiovascular events.\\n\\n3. **Anatomical Findings Suggestive of Severe Coronary Artery Disease**:\\n   - Revascularization is often recommended for patients with significant coronary artery disease, such as:\\n     - Left main coronary artery stenosis (>50%).\\n     - Multivessel disease with reduced left ventricular function.\\n     - Proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis.\\n\\n4. **Improvement in Quality of Life**:\\n   - For patients whose angina significantly limits daily activities or quality of life, revascularization may be considered to alleviate symptoms.\\n\\n5. **Prognostic Benefit**:\\n   - In certain cases, revascularization may improve survival, particularly in patients with high-risk coronary anatomy or severe left ventricular dysfunction.\\n\\nRevascularization can be achieved through **percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)** or **coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)**, depending on the patient's clinical profile, coronary anatomy, and comorbidities. The choice between PCI and CABG is guided by factors such as the complexity of coronary disease (e.g., SYNTAX score), patient preferences, and surgical risk.\\n\\nIt is important to note that in patients with chronic stable angina, revascularization is not always necessary and is typically reserved for those who meet the above criteria. Medical therapy remains the cornerstone of management for most patients.\"]\n"

These include:\\n\\n### 1. **Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) Test**\\n   - **Purpose**: IGF-1 is a hormone produced in response to GH. Its levels are more stable throughout the day compared to GH, making it a reliable marker for assessing GH activity.\\n   - **Interpretation**: Elevated IGF-1 levels are indicative of excessive GH activity. IGF-1 levels are age- and sex-dependent, so they must be compared to reference ranges.\\n\\n### 2. **Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) with GH Measurement**\\n   - **Purpose**: This is the gold standard test for diagnosing acromegaly. GH secretion is normally suppressed after oral glucose intake.\\n   - **Procedure**: The patient drinks a glucose solution, and GH levels are measured at intervals (e.g., 0, 30, 60, 120 minutes).\\n   - **Interpretation**: Failure of GH levels to suppress below a certain threshold (e.g., <1 ng/mL, depending on the assay) confirms elevated GH activity.\\n\\n### 3. **Random GH Levels**\\n   - **Purpose**: GH levels fluctuate throughout the day, so a single random measurement is not typically diagnostic. However, very high random GH levels may suggest excessive GH secretion.\\n   - **Limitations**: GH secretion is pulsatile, so random levels are less reliable than IGF-1 or OGTT.\\n\\n### 4. **MRI of the Pituitary Gland**\\n   - **Purpose**: If elevated GH activity is confirmed biochemically, imaging is performed to identify a pituitary adenoma or other structural abnormalities causing excess GH secretion.\\n   - **Interpretation**: A pituitary tumor is often the cause of elevated GH levels in acromegaly or gigantism.\\n\\n### 5. **Other Hormonal Tests**\\n   - **Purpose**: Additional tests may be performed to assess pituitary function and rule out other hormonal imbalances.\\n   - **Examples**: Prolactin levels (to check for co-secretion), thyroid function tests, and adrenal hormone levels.\\n\\n### Summary of Diagnostic Approach:\\n1. Measure IGF-1 levels (initial screening test).\\n2. Perform OGTT with GH measurement if IGF-1 is elevated.\\n3. Conduct pituitary MRI if biochemical tests confirm elevated GH activity.\\n4. Evaluate other pituitary hormones as needed.\\n\\nThese tests, together with clinical signs and symptoms (e.g., enlarged hands, feet, facial features), help confirm the diagnosis of elevated GH activity and its underlying cause.', 'The imaging modality most commonly used to identify a **pituitary adenoma** is **magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**. MRI provides detailed images of the soft tissues in the brain, including the pituitary gland, and is the gold standard for evaluating pituitary adenomas. \\n\\nKey points about MRI for pituitary adenomas:\\n- **Contrast-enhanced MRI** is typically performed using gadolinium-based contrast agents to better visualize the tumor and differentiate it from surrounding structures.\\n- It is particularly effective in detecting **microadenomas** (tumors <10 mm) and **macroadenomas** (tumors ≥10 mm).\\n- MRI can also assess the extent of the tumor, including compression of adjacent structures like the optic chiasm.\\n\\nIn some cases, **computed tomography (CT)** may be used, especially if MRI is contraindicated or unavailable, but CT is less sensitive for detecting small pituitary adenomas.']\n"

Common causes include:\\n\\n### 1. **Heart-Related Conditions**\\n   - **Coronary artery disease (CAD):** Reduced blood flow to the heart can damage the heart's electrical system.\\n   - **Heart attack:** Scar tissue from a previous heart attack can disrupt electrical signals.\\n   - **Heart failure:** Weak or damaged heart muscle can lead to abnormal rhythms.\\n   - **Cardiomyopathy:** Changes in the heart muscle structure can interfere with electrical signals.\\n   - **Congenital heart defects:** Structural abnormalities present at birth can affect the heart's rhythm.\\n\\n### 2. **Electrolyte Imbalances**\\n   - Low or high levels of potassium, calcium, magnesium, or sodium can disrupt the electrical impulses in the heart.\\n\\n### 3. **Medications**\\n   - Certain drugs, such as beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics, or stimulants, can affect heart rhythm.\\n   - Overuse of medications like decongestants or asthma treatments can also trigger arrhythmias.\\n\\n### 4. **Substance Use**\\n   - Excessive consumption of caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, or recreational drugs (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines) can lead to arrhythmias.\\n\\n### 5. **Stress and Anxiety**\\n   - Emotional stress or anxiety can trigger arrhythmias, often through the release of stress hormones like adrenaline.\\n\\n### 6. **Thyroid Disorders**\\n   - Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) or hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) can affect heart rate and rhythm.\\n\\n### 7. **Sleep Disorders**\\n   - Conditions like sleep apnea can lead to arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation.\\n\\n### 8. **Infections or Fever**\\n   - Viral infections, myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), or high fever can disrupt the heart's electrical activity.\\n\\n### 9. **Genetic Factors**\\n   - Inherited conditions, such as Long QT Syndrome or Brugada Syndrome, can predispose individuals to arrhythmias.\\n\\n### 10. **Other Factors**\\n   - **Aging:** The risk of arrhythmias increases with age due to changes in the heart's structure and function.\\n   - **Physical exertion:** Intense exercise can sometimes trigger arrhythmias, especially in individuals with underlying heart conditions.\\n   - **Dehydration:** Severe dehydration can lead to electrolyte imbalances, increasing the risk of arrhythmias.\\n\\nIf you suspect an arrhythmia, it’s important to consult a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment.\", \"Electrolyte imbalances can lead to irritation of cardiac muscles because electrolytes, such as potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium, play critical roles in maintaining the electrical activity and contractility of the heart. The heart relies on a precise balance of these ions to generate and propagate electrical signals that coordinate its rhythmic contractions. When electrolyte levels are disrupted, the following mechanisms can lead to irritation of cardiac muscles:\\n\\n1. **Disruption of Action Potential Generation and Propagation**:\\n   - Cardiac muscle cells depend on the movement of ions across their membranes to generate action potentials. For example, sodium influx initiates depolarization, while potassium efflux is responsible for repolarization. Calcium ions are essential for the contraction of cardiac muscle fibers.\\n   - Imbalances in these electrolytes can alter the resting membrane potential and the ability of cardiac cells to depolarize and repolarize properly, leading to abnormal electrical activity, arrhythmias, or increased excitability of the cardiac muscle.\\n\\n2. **Hyperkalemia (Excess Potassium)**:\\n   - Elevated potassium levels reduce the resting membrane potential, making cardiac cells more excitable. This can lead to arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation or asystole, and impair the heart's ability to contract effectively.\\n\\n3. **Hypokalemia (Low Potassium)**:\\n   - Low potassium levels can prolong repolarization and increase the risk of early afterdepolarizations, which can trigger arrhythmias like torsades de pointes. Hypokalemia also reduces the heart's ability to respond to electrical signals appropriately.\\n\\n4. **Hypercalcemia (Excess Calcium)**:\\n   - Excess calcium can increase the contractility of cardiac muscle, leading to hyperexcitability and potentially causing arrhythmias. It can also shorten the action potential duration, disrupting the normal rhythm of the heart.\\n\\n5. **Hypocalcemia (Low Calcium)**:\\n   - Low calcium levels impair the contraction of cardiac muscle fibers, as calcium is essential for the interaction between actin and myosin during muscle contraction. This can weaken the heart's pumping ability and lead to irritability of the cardiac muscle.\\n\\n6. **Magnesium Imbalances**:\\n   - Magnesium is crucial for stabilizing the electrical activity of the heart and regulating potassium and calcium levels. Hypomagnesemia can lead to arrhythmias by increasing excitability and impairing the balance of other electrolytes. Hypermagnesemia, though less common, can depress cardiac activity and lead to conduction abnormalities.\\n\\n7. **Impact on the Conduction System**:\\n   - Electrolyte imbalances can affect the sinoatrial (SA) node, atrioventricular (AV) node, and Purkinje fibers, which are responsible for coordinating the heart's electrical signals. This can result in bradycardia, tachycardia, or other conduction disturbances.\\n\\nIn summary, electrolyte imbalances disrupt the delicate ionic gradients required for normal cardiac function, leading to irritation, abnormal electrical activity, and impaired contractility of the cardiac muscles. This can result in arrhythmias, reduced cardiac output, and potentially life-threatening complications.\"]\n"

Hypertension is a major risk factor for structural heart changes, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation, which can predispose individuals to arrhythmias. \\n\\nA cardiology referral may be warranted if:\\n\\n1. **Arrhythmia is suspected or confirmed**: If a patient with severe hypertension presents with symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, syncope, or irregular heartbeats, further evaluation by a cardiologist may be necessary.\\n\\n2. **Complications of hypertension**: Severe hypertension can lead to complications like heart failure or ischemic heart disease, which are associated with arrhythmias.\\n\\n3. **Uncontrolled hypertension despite treatment**: If blood pressure remains uncontrolled despite optimal management, a cardiologist may be consulted to assess for secondary causes or associated cardiac conditions.\\n\\n4. **Atrial fibrillation**: Hypertension is a leading cause of atrial fibrillation, and patients with this arrhythmia often require cardiology input for management, including anticoagulation and rhythm or rate control strategies.\\n\\nIn summary, while severe hypertension does not directly necessitate a cardiology referral for arrhythmia, the presence of arrhythmia symptoms or complications related to hypertension may prompt such a referral.']\n"

        "2. If User Input asked about rules and regulation of some country then LLM Answer should have no connection between previous conversation so LLM Answer should be about rules and regulation of that country.\n",

        "Wrong scenario based on Dict_5 from <chat_history>:\n",

        "\n",
        "Keep this as reference example while checking the Conflicting Information and Consideration of Chat History criteria.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Evaluation Criteria:**\n",
        "1. **Direct Topical Relevance (Weight: 1.0):** How directly and accurately does the LLM's response address the core question, request, or statement in the \"User Input,\" independent of any persona? Is the response on the same subject? Does it provide a clear and relevant answer or action?\n",
        "2. **Persona Consistency (Weight: 1.5 - Applicable ONLY if a Persona is Defined):** If a \"Defined Persona\" is provided, how consistently and effectively does the LLM's response embody that persona in terms of tone, style, language, behaviours, and any other defined characteristics? Are there any noticeable deviations from the established persona? (If no persona is defined, this criterion receives a score of N/A and its weight is not factored into the total).\n",
        "3. **Absence of Conflicting Information (Weight: 1.5):** Does the current response contradict any information, agreements, or established context within the \"Chat History\" or any aspects of the \"Defined Persona\" (if applicable)?\n",
        "4. **Efficiency and Conciseness (within Relevance) (Weight: 0.5):** Is the response reasonably concise and focused on the relevant aspects of the conversation and persona (if applicable), avoiding unnecessary information, tangents, or overly verbose language?\n",
        "5. **Consideration of Chat History (Weight: 3.5):**\n",
        "   * If the user expressed dissatisfaction in previous turns, explain whether and how the current response attempts to rectify that. Quote the relevant turns.\n",
        "   * If the user explicitly asked for a rephrasing or a new idea in previous turns, explain whether and how the current response fulfills that specific request. Quote the relevant turns.\n",
        "   * Identify any instances where the current response could have better built upon previously provided information or adapted more effectively to the evolving user intent throughout the conversation. Explain what the LLM could have done differently.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Scoring Guidance (0-10):**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **9-10 - Exceptionally Relevant:** The response is perfectly aligned topically with the current input and chat history. If a persona is defined, it is also flawlessly and consistently embodied.\n",
        "* **7-8 - Highly Relevant:** The response is strongly relevant topically and demonstrates good awareness of the chat history. If a persona is defined, it is consistently maintained with only minor imperfections.\n",
        "* **5-6 - Moderately Relevant:** The response addresses the main points of the user input and shows some connection to the chat history. If a persona is defined, it is present but may have some noticeable inconsistencies or areas for improvement.\n",
        "* **3-4 - Poorly Relevant:** The response only partially addresses the user input or shows a weak connection to the chat history. If a persona is defined, there are significant deviations from the established character.\n",
        "* **1-2 - Very Poorly Relevant:** The response is largely irrelevant to the user input and/or chat history. If a persona is defined, it is poorly or inconsistently applied.\n",
        "* **0 - Not Relevant:** The response fails to address the user input or is completely disconnected from the conversation history. If a persona is defined, it is either entirely absent or actively contradicted.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Important Instruction:**\n",
        "The current LLM response might attempt to be more helpful or convenient for the user by slightly altering the current response based on very old chat conversation. **You must be strict in assigning the score and penalize any deviation from the immediate question and answer from the chat_history, even if the intention seems helpful.** The goal is to evaluate the LLM's ability to consistently embody the chat_history, not to prioritize user convenience over response accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Evaluate the relevance of the LLM's response based on its topical connection to the user's current input and the preceding chat history.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **If a 'Defined Persona' is provided:** Also meticulously assess how well the response embodies that persona across all defined characteristics. The final relevance score should reflect a holistic evaluation of both topical relevance and persona consistency. A response that is strongly in character but fails to adequately address the user's needs within the conversational context is not truly relevant.\n",
        "* **If No Persona Defined is indicated:** Focus solely on the topical relevance of the response to the user input and the chat history. Persona consistency should not be considered in your evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Provide a detailed justification for your assigned score, referencing specific parts of the \"User Input,\" \"LLM Response,\" and \"Chat History.\" If a persona is defined, explicitly address its consistency within your justification. Explain how you weighed the different criteria in arriving at your final score.\n",
