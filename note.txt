                       - Prioritize brevity, **aim for a 30-50% reduction in length** while preserving core meaning and tone.
                       - Use conversational, informal expressions where possible (like "Need help" instead of "I require assistance").
                    2. **Preserve CSR and Customer Labels:**
                       - Ensure each line **retains the CSR: or Customer: label** at the start.
                       - Do NOT remove or modify the speaker label.
                    3. **Maintain Core Meaning and Tone:**
                       - While making it concise, **do not change the context, meaning, or speaker intent**.
                       - Maintain clear logic, ensure all critical information (like names, dates, and reservation details) remains intact.
                    4. **Uniformity:**
                       - Ensure **brevity is applied uniformly** to all customer, CSR, and supervisor (if present) dialogue.
                       - Every single line of dialogue must be processed. No skipped lines.
